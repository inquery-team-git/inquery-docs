## Account Creation and Login

In order to create an account, you will need to request a registration link from an existing user at your organization or from the InQuery team directly.

Registration links look like this:
```
https://app.inquery.ai/register/<registration-token>?organization_id=<your-organization-id>
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Existing Organization">
    If your organization already has an InQuery account, you will need to request access from an existing user at your organization.
    They will be able to send you a registration link from their dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="New Organization">
    If your organization does not have an existing InQuery account, you will need to reach out to contact@tryinquery.com to register your organization. 
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Once you have a registration link, you will need to register your account by filling out the following form:

After registration, you should land on the main InQuery dashboard.
