# Overview

A guide to creating, managing, and organizing cases.

## What is a case?
A case is a collection of records that are related to a single legal matter. Cases are used to organize and manage records, and to track the status of a case.

## Creating a case

To create a case, click on "+ New Case" in the top right corner of the screen.

This should open a pop-up window to fill out information about the case and upload your records.

To create a case, you will need to upload at least one pdf file containing records related to the case. 

You will also need to fill out <em>either</em> the "Patient Name" or the "Case Number" in order to uniquely identify the case.

The case type is also a mandatory field. The case type will be used to determine which tags to use for your records and determine whether each section is related to the case.

## Pending and Available Cases
Once you finish creating a case, it will appear in your list of Pending Cases. InQuery takes 2-4 hours to process each case. Once the case is processed, it will be moved to your list of Available Cases and you will be able to view the processed case.

## Sorting and filtering cases

You can sort cases by selecting the up and down arrows next to each column header. 

You can filter cases by using the search bar at the top of the page. The search bar will search for the patient name assigned to each case.

## Updating Case Metadata

The case metadata can only be updated from inside of a case. To update the case metadata, click on the case you want to update, then click on whichever field you would like to update in the top left corner of the case home screen.

## Case (Executive) Summaries
The executive case summaries are generated as a narrative summary of the contents of the case. If you upload multiple files, all files will be considered as input to the case summary by default. In order to filter out specific content from being included in the case summary, you can filter out sections from the case using the standard filter function 
then use the re-run button to the right of the Executive Summary header in order to re-generate the case summary using only the content that has not been filtered. You may regenerate or edit the summary as many times as needed.

To download the case summary as a separate pdf file, click on the "Download" icon to the right of the Executive Summary header.

To download the executive summary as part of the final case file, click on the "Download" icon at the top of the exhibit list and check the box next to the "Executive Summary".
