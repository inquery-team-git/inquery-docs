A Section is a sequence of consecutive pages in a file that pertain to a specific topic. InQuery will add multiple bookmarks to each file to delineate document sections, since there are often multiple relevant sections in a single file.

To group records together, click on the "Group by Document Type" button indicated by the stack of papers icon in the exhibit list tool section.

This button will automatically group together all records with the same tag. Any sections labeled as "Provider Notes" will be sub-grouped by the name of the treating physician/provider.

Click this button again to ungroup the records.

## Sorting Records

Records/sections can be sorted by page number, relevance score, date, title, or the length of the document.

<Frame className="mx-auto">
  <img src="/images/section-management/sort-feature.png" alt="Sort by Page Number" />
</Frame>

They can be sorted before or after they've been grouped into their respective document types.

For a given sort feature, the records can be sorted in either ascending or descending order, which you can control using the up and down arrows next to the sort feature selector.

</Frame>

## Filtering Records

InQuery gives users many different ways to filter out pages and records from the exhibit list and the final case file.

Users may want to filter out pages that are blank, duplicate, or otherwise not relevant to the case, like fax cover sheets or administrative forms that are not relevant to the case.

The main way to filter out records in InQuery is at the record level, which can be done by using the "Filter" button in the exhibit list tool section.

<Frame className="mx-auto">
  <img src="/images/section-management/filter-preview.png" alt="Filter Button" />
</Frame>

You can filter records by the provider name, document type, tag, or relevance score. You can apply multiple filters at once.
<Accordion title="Document Name">
  Document name lets you search your records by name. Simply type in part or all of the name you're looking for and InQuery will filter the records accordingly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Document Type">
  The Document Type selector allows you to choose which records to include based on the document type. In most cases, you will want to select "All" to include all records and then filter out document types that are not relevant to the case.
  <Frame className="mx-auto">
    <img src="/images/section-management/document-type-filter.png" alt="Document Type Filter" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Relevance">
  The Relevance filter allows you to choose which records to include based on the relevance score. In most cases, you will want to select "All" to include all records and then filter out records that are not relevant to the case.
  <Frame className="mx-auto">
    <img src="/images/section-management/relevance-filter.png" alt="Relevance Filter" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Date Range">
  The Date Range filter allows you to choose which records to include based on the date range. 

  To filter by date, enter a start date in the first field and an end date in the second field.

  Click on the "x" icon to clear the date range filter.

## Customizing Name and Tag Defaults
InQuery applies a standard set of naming conventions and a default set of tags to the records in your case.

These defaults can be customized by each organization and for different case types upon request.

## Re-run the Executive Summary
You can re-run the executive summary at any time by clicking the refresh next to the executive summary header.

The executive summary only considers sections that have not been filtered out and pages that have not been hidden from view, so you can optionally filter out content from the executive summary that you think may be sensitive or otherwise not relevant to the case.
